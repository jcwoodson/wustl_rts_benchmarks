IN THE MAKEFILE IN THIS DIRECTORY THERE ARE LINES COMMENTED OUT.  THESE LINES NEED
TO BE UNCOMMENTED THE FIRST TIME YOU RUN MAKE AND TESTINPUTS FROM ANY ONE OF THE RAYCAST
ALOGRITHMS.  AFTER THE FIRST TIME, THOUGH, THEY SHOULD BE COMMENTED OUT BEFORE RUNNING
TESTINPUTS AGAIN. (They do not need to be uncommented once for each algorithm, only
the absolute first time running this benchmark.)
